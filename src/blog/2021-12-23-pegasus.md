Earlier this year, it was reported that Israel-based firm 

NSO Group

 was engaged by governments to target activists, politicians and journalists. NSO Group is notorious for selling hacking solutions to high-profile clients. The firm used 

Pegasus

 — a spyware package — to hack smartphones, including 

iPhones

. Since the report has come to light the US has banned companies from doing any business with NSO Group, whereas 

Apple

 has sued the firm as well. Now, 

Google

 has detailed in a blog how Pegasus was used to hack iPhones.
